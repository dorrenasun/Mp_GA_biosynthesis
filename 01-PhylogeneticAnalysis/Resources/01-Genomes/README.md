# Notes for integrating protein sequences from published genomes
- This is a script to parse and combine peptide sequences from published genomes

- All the sequences were manually collected and put into a folder called "Resources" (not included in this depository). Sources of the data files are collected in the excel file "List_of_sources.xlsx"

- Please modify "List_of_sources.xlsx" to select files to be included.

- Run "01-CombineGenome.R" to merge sequences. The outputs will be in a folder called "Combined" in this directory.
