# Notes for integrating protein sequences from OneKP project
- This is a script to parse and combine peptide sequences from [the 1000 Plants (OneKP or 1KP) project](https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/onekp/)

- Run "00-Download1kp-2022.r" to automatically download sequences from the OneKP database. The clades to download and merge are included in "Prefixes.csv", which will also provide prefixes for the parsed sequence names. Downloaded sequence files will be in a folder called "Download" in this directory.

- Run "01-CombineOneKP.R" to merge sequences. The outputs will be in a folder called "Extracted" in this directory.
